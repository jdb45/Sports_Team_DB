# Sports_Team_DB

This program will keep track of items sold at a sports game! This is not a POS, this is the database side only. 
There are three items that can be sold and it will keep track of all the items and totals sold for each game entered.
The user will enter the date and opponent for each game and can query data to see the highest selling item, lowest selling item, 
and highest grossing game!
There is no GUI for this, is it text based only.

*This program uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy*
